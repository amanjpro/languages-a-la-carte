# Sana Compiler Framework

[] [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amanjpro/sana.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amanjpro/sana)

Sana is an extensible compiler framework written in Scala. As a research
project, Sana aims to be both fully modular in a sense that removing a new
language component should be as easy as adding a new one. Sana also tries to be
safe and immutable in most of the cases, but not when it adds a considerable
amount of overhead. Sana implements ``languages Ã  la carte'' which is proposed
by Amanj Sherwany.



## Installation

To play with Sana, first clone the project:
```
git clone github.com/amanjpro/languages-a-la-carte
```

Then, using `sbt` you can build the wanted target. For example to build the
`tiny` language, you do:

```
sbt tiny/compile
```

[] Please consult the project's [wiki](https://github.com/amanjpro/sana/wiki)
to know all possible targets.

You can generate a fat jar by running assembly for your target, for example for
`tiny` it will be:

```
sbt tiny/assembly
```


## Usage

[] Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/amanjpro/sana/wiki)
