# Sana Compiler Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/amanjpro/languages-a-la-carte.svg?token=xagHpp4qXzfWp5WxM1j3)](https://travis-ci.com/amanjpro/languages-a-la-carte)

Sana is an extensible compiler framework written in Scala. Sana aims to be both
fully modular in a sense that removing a new language component should be as
easy as adding a new one, in a type-safe manner. Sana implements ``languages Ã 
la carte'' which is proposed by Amanj Sherwany and Nate Nystrom. As proof of
concept, Sana implements the compiler for Java 1.0 among other languages.

## Installation

To play with Sana, first clone the project:
```
git clone github.com/amanjpro/languages-a-la-carte
```

Then, using `sbt` you can build the wanted target. For example to build the
`tiny` language, you do:

```
sbt tiny/compile
```

Please consult the project's [wiki](https://github.com/amanjpro/languages-a-la-carte/wiki)
to know all possible targets.

You can generate a fat jar by running assembly for your target, for example for
`tiny` it will be:

```
sbt tiny/assembly
```

To generate ANTLR grammar, you can use antlr4:antlr4Generate task, for primj it will be:

```
sbt primj/antlr4:antlr4Generate
```

There are two sets of tests, the unit tests can be executed in sbt using:
```
sbt tests
```

And the integration tests can run using:
```
./runtests [recompile] (module name or all)
```
